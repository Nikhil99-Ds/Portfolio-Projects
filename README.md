1st we take the Covid Data file and Divide it into Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations

2nd after Segregating the Data into these 2 files we check for the Null valures if there are any and replace it with zero

3rd after Pre-proccessing our Data we then perform various SQL Queries for analysing our data using Microsoft SQL 

4th Running the Queries and Selecting the desired qureies we want and then importing/copy & pasting them into Our EXCEL file name - Tableau table-1,2,3,4

5th Importing these Excel Tableau tables in Tableau and Visualizing and Forecasting the Data to observe and Predict the No.of cases and Infected no.of persons till May 2022
