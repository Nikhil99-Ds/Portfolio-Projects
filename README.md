Here in this Project I have Analysed the Covid Data from Feb 2020 to Sept 2021


  APPROACH
	
1st we take the Covid Data file and Divide it into Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations

2nd after segregating the Data into these 2 files we check for the Null valures if there are any and replace it with zero

3rd after Pre-proccessing our Data we then perform various SQL Queries for analysing our data using Microsoft SQL 

4th Running the Queries and Selecting the desired qureies we want and then importing/copy & pasting them into Our EXCEL file name - Tableau Data 1,2,3,4

5th Importing these Excel Tableau tables in Tableau and Visualising and Forecasting the Data to Observe and Predict the No.of cases, Total Population Infected, Country wise Infection Rate, Death Count per Continent and Avg Infected Population Percentage - forecasting this till May 2022
